# KyselyApp
## Web application for creating and answering quizzes 

`frontend/` contains the code for the React frontend and TailwindCSS styling definitions

`KyselyApp/` contains the Java Spring Boot code and Thymeleaf templates


## To run

`cd frontend` and use `yarn` or `npm install`  
To build the frontend and Tailwind styling do `yarn build` or `npm run build`
This will automatically build the files to Spring Boots static folder


If you already had the Java project open in Eclipse, you need to refresh the project after building
the frontend. 
This can be done by right clicking on the project in Eclipse's project explorer, and clicking on
refresh.

Now you can just start the server normally through Eclipse
